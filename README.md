## About the Video Course
AWS Lambda and the serverless framework is the best way to get started in the serverless world, to deploy AWS Lambda functions in Amazon Web Services that infinitely scale without managing any servers! Building backend for your web and mobile applications has never been easier. AWS created this revolutionary product in 2014 named AWS Lambda; in which you don't have to run servers, you just run functions! You can then infinitely scale your backend automatically based on the load you are getting. The days of managing a fleet of servers are over! AWS is the next IT revolution, and you are in the right place to learn about the best tools to get started with it!
